# Notebook Fan Control

NBFC is a cross-platform fan control service for notebooks.
It comes with a powerful configuration system, which allows to adjust it to many different notebook models. This project has been forked from https://github.com/hirschmann/nbfc and mainly focuses on revamping the UI.
